Lightweight utilities to make programming easier (or more complex depending on the user).

___

Some functions and classes that may be usefulÂ to you.

Mostly done to learn something new, but I don't want to waste it.

Only requirement is to be simple (small), have a purpose and maybe a real case.

It's nice to have code that just works by copying the file to the project. :)

Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding new ones
- Improving existing ones
- Covering more cases
- Configuring a test framework
- Adding tests

Feel free to use it on anything (that's why it's MIT license), including commercial products, Stackoverflow questions and answers.

Keeping in mind that I provide no guarantee.
